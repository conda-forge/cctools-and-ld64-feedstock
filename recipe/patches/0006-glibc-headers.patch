Something about the glibc headers makes it so that if things are included in
the wrong order, you can get errors like the following:

```
In file included from work/cctools/ld64/src/ld/libcodedirectory.c:42:
In file included from $HOST/include/dispatch/dispatch.h:44:
In file included from work/cctools/include/foreign/fcntl.h:1:
In file included from $BUILD/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu/sysroot/usr/include/fcntl.h:77:
$BUILD/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu/sysroot/usr/include/bits/stat.h:106:31: error: expected member name or ';' after declaration specifiers
  106 |     __syscall_slong_t __unused[3];
```

We can avoid these issues by making sure that certain headers are included
sufficiently early.
